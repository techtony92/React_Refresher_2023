				 *
				 * * React createElement can take text or components. Since we give it text
				 * * it is looking to render an HTML tag (h1,p,a, etc). We can place any text there, but if it
				 * * is not a valid html tag, then it will not be recognized by the browser as a valid html Tag.
				 *
				 * * If we give React.createElement a component(denoted with a identifier that is a function with a Capital letter)
				 * * react will render that component as a react element.
				 *
				 * * React.createElement Takes 3 parameters:
				 * @param TagNAME : string | ReactComponent `Mandatory`
				 * @param HTMLElementAttributes { attributeName:string IE: id:root} `Optional`
				 * @param Children : string | ReactComponent `Optional`

			 * * ReactDom.createRoot(rootElement)
			 * * Create root is the newest way to append react elements to the dom. Before
			 * * react 18, the way to do this was `ReactDom.Render(rootElement, <App />)`,
			 * * but in react 18 , we got a feature called `concurrency` which used be called `concurrent mode`.
			 * * This is a way to opt-in to new features of react. React.createRoot basically tells react itself
			 * * 'this project is using the new features of react'.
			 *
			 * * ReactDom.Render() basically puts the project into legacy mode.
			 * * You can also use your root identifier to call render() to have react re-render.(This is very special edge case though)
